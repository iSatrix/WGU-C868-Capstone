# WGU-C868-Capstone
Capstone project for my BSITSW degree.

For my capstone project I needed to solve a business need using all the skills I learned though my degree program.  
The "doc1.pdf" is a document I put together explaining my customer and their business problem with my proposed solution.
The "doc2.pdf" is a document containing several things: design plan, uml diagrams, testing plan, user guide, and more
The "src" folder contains my application's source code.

For my capstone application I upgraded a previous project of mine called the Appointment Scheduler.  I added a search functionality to my customer and appointment tables.  These changes are explained in doc1 and doc2.
